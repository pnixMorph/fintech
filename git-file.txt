I am addding a new line to the file
I am alive in Christ
Can not understand why my arrow buttons are not working on Visual Studio
Like I said it works well on MobaxTerm and Gitbash. Not sure why its not working on
Visual Studio.
I need to investigate the changes I tried in bashfc or bashprofile # hope its well

Ok it works on ssh but not bash visual studio
